# node-localization-in-wireless-sensor-networks
Reliable localization of sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is essential for applications in military surveillance and forest monitoring. However, accurate positioning becomes difficult in these areas due to dense vegetation, rugged terrain, and signal obstruction caused by natural and man-made barriers. Classical multilateration often performs poorly under such conditions because RSSI values fluctuate heavily and do not follow ideal propagation patterns. This work presents a deep learning–based localization approach that learns the underlying relationship between RSSI readings and distance, even when signals are distorted or weakened. A complete web-based simulator, developed using React, Node.js, and a Python Flask backend, supports real-time visualization, creation of synthetic datasets through the Log-Normal Shadowing Model, and evaluation of different localization methods. The proposed model achieves an average error of 9.01 meters, which is significantly lower than the 18–27 meters typically observed with multilateration. The results show that this approach provides a more stable and terrain-adapted solution for military and forest WSN deployments.
