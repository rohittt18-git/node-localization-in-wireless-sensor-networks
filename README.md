# node-localization-in-wireless-sensor-networks
Reliable sensor localization in WSNs is challenging in forests and military areas due to signal distortion. This work uses a deep learning model to map RSSI to distance. A web-based simulator evaluates methods, achieving 9.01 m error versus 18–27 m in multilateration.
